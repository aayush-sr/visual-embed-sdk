:page-description: Embed authentication

You can use any of the following authentication methods to authenticate your application users and allow access to the embedded ThoughtSpot content.

* xref:embed-authentication.adoc#saml-sso-embed[SAML SSO authentication]
* xref:embed-authentication.adoc#trusted-auth-embed[Trusted authentication]
* xref:embed-authentication.adoc#oidc-auth[OpenID Connect authentication]
* xref:embed-authentication.adoc#basic-auth-embed[Basic authentication with ThoughtSpot login API]
* xref:embed-authentication.adoc#no-auth-embed[No authentication]

[IMPORTANT]
====
ThoughtSpot recommends that you use the SAML SSO or trusted authentication method in production environments.
====

== Authentication methods

[#saml-sso-embed]
=== SAML SSO authentication
To allow federated users to sign in to ThoughtSpot with their SSO credentials, you can enable SAML authentication on ThoughtSpot. With SSO, you can use your host application or an external service as the identity provider, and allow authenticated users to access ThoughtSpot content.

==== Prerequisites
To use SAML SSO authentication, the ThoughtSpot administrator must enable SAML authentication and add the SAML redirect domains to the allowed list. For more information, see xref:configure-saml.adoc[SAML SSO].

==== Enable SSO authentication in Visual Embed SDK

To configure SAML SSO authentication for embed users, set the `authType` attribute to `SSO`. 

[source,javascript]
----
init({
    thoughtSpotHost: "https://<hostname>:<port>",
    authType: AuthType.SSO,
});
----

If you want the SAML SSO authentication workflow to open in a pop-up window, instead of refreshing the application page to show the SAML login page, you can set the `noRedirect` parameter to `true`.

[source,javascript]
----
init({
    thoughtSpotHost: "https://<hostname>:<port>",
    authType: AuthType.SSO,
    noRedirect: true,
});
----

The user should have already gone through the SAML flow when entering the embedding application, prior to encountering any ThoughtSpot content. For the SSO experience to be completely seamless, the user must already have a valid session with the IdP, so that the IdP automatically sends a SAML assertion back to ThoughtSpot.

The SAML authentication workflow occurs when the actual ThoughtSpot content is loaded into the iframe generated by the Visual Embed SDK.  If the user is not logged into the IdP, the IdP will present its login page and then send the assertion to ThoughtSpot after the user enters their credentials.

[#oidc-auth]
=== OpenID Connect SSO authentication [tag greenBackground]#NEW in 8.0.0.cl#

If your app supports OAuth 2.0 protocol and requires OIDC authentication framework, you can enable the OpenID Connect authentication on your embedded ThoughtSpot instance.

Before you enable the OIDC authentication type, make sure your ThoughtSpot instance is xref:configure-oidc.adoc[integrated with the OpenID provider and set up for OIDC authentication]. 

[source,javascript]
----
init({
    thoughtSpotHost: "https://<hostname>:<port>",
    authType: AuthType.OIDC,
});
----

[#trusted-auth-embed]
=== Trusted authentication

In the trusted authentication method, a security token is required to authenticate users who request access to the embedded ThoughtSpot content. For token-based authentication, you will require an authenticator server or service, which can securely authenticate your application users. 

For token-based authentication, the following attributes are required:

* Secret key
+
The token-based authentication requires you to xref:trusted-authentication.adoc#trusted-auth-enable[enable trusted authentication] on ThoughtSpot to ensure that your authenticator server has access to a ThoughtSpot secret key. This secret key allows the authenticator server to request a login token __for any user__ on the ThoughtSpot Server. The login token is then sent to the user's web browser, where it is used in the login process.

* Username
+
The `username` of the user for whom the token is required.  

* Authentication endpoint
+
The URL endpoint of the server that provides the authentication token.

==== Configure token-based authentication method in Visual Embed SDK

To configure the token-based authentication method in the Visual Embed SDK, set the `authType` attribute as `AuthServer`. 

To obtain authentication tokens, you can either set the `authEndPoint` attribute or call the `getAuthToken` method:  

* `**authEndpoint**`
+
Specify the authentication endpoint URL from which you want to obtain the authentication token. When a `GET` request is sent to the specified endpoint URL to obtain the token, the authentication server sends the token as plain text.  

+
[source,javascript]
----
init({
    thoughtSpotHost: "https://<hostname>:<port>",
    authType: AuthType.AuthServer,
    username: "<username>",
    authEndpoint: "https://authenticator-server:<port>/endpoint",
});
----

* `**getAuthToken**`

+
You can call the `getAuthToken` function to invoke your login endpoint. The login endpoint then returns a `Promise` string that resolves to an authentication token.

+
[NOTE]
====
The generated authentication token is valid for only five minutes. Make sure the `getAuthToken` function returns a fresh token for each re-login.
====

+
[source,javascript]
----
init({
    thoughtSpotHost: "https://<hostname>:<port>",
    authType: AuthType.AuthServer,
    username: "<username>",
    getAuthToken: () => Promise.resolve(token),
});
----

+
After obtaining the token, a GET request to the `/tspublic/v1/session/login/token` endpoint is sent with the `username` and authentication token. If the request is successful, the SDK renders the embedded content. 

In contrast to the SAML workflow, the trusted authentication workflow logs in via AJAX requests that are not visible to the end user, even if they fail. You can listen to the xref:embed-events.adoc[AuthInit event] using the Visual Embed SDK to detect and respond to errors in the login process.

[#basic-auth-embed]
=== Basic authentication with ThoughtSpot login API

In this method, users can log in to ThoughtSpot by sending a POST request to `xref:session-api.adoc#session-login[/tspublic/v1/session/login]` API endpoint. Users can pass their `username` and `password` in the API `POST` request to authenticate and access ThoughtSpot content.  `/tspublic/v1/session/login` API. For more information, see xref:session-api.adoc[Session API]. 

To enable basic authentication method in the Visual Embed SDK, set the `authType` attribute to `Basic` as shown here:

[source,javascript]
----
init({
    thoughtSpotHost: "https://<hostname>:<port>",
    authType: AuthType.Basic,
});
----

[WARNING]
You can use this authentication method for initial development and testing. ThoughtSpot does not recommend this authentication method for production environments.

[#no-auth-embed]
=== No authentication
You can choose to specify no authentication method for your users. The local ThoughtSpot users who are already logged into your application can access the embedded ThoughtSpot content.   

To allow your logged-in application users to access ThoughtSpot content without any authentication, set the `authType` attribute to `None` as shown here:

[source,javascript]
----
init({
    thoughtSpotHost: "https://<hostname>:<port>",
    authType: AuthType.None,
});
----

[WARNING]
====
Do not use this authentication method in production environments.
