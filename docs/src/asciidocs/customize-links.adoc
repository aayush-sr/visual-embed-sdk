:page-description: Customize link format

ThoughtSpot users receive system-generated links in email notifications, which allow them to access various objects such as Liveboards and visualizations. By default, the links generated by ThoughtSpot point users to a standalone ThoughtSpot application URL. If you have embedded ThoughtSpot in your application, you might want to generate links in the format that preserves your host application context. ThoughtSpot allows you to customize the format of these links in the ThoughtSpot Developer portal.

== System-generated links

ThoughtSpot generates links during various operations:

* Links to Liveboards
+
These links provide access to a Liveboard object and are sent in email notifications in the following scenarios:

** When a user shares a Liveboard with another user
** When a user schedules a job for a Liveboard and adds recipients to receive email notification about the job status

* Links to visualizations within a Liveboard
+
ThoughtSpot users can copy these links  and send these to another user through emails or messaging platforms like Slack.

* Links to answers
+
These links provide access to answers from a search query. ThoughtSpot sends these links in email notifications when a user shares an answer with another user or a user group.

* Links to the SpotIQ analyses page
+
ThoughtSpot generates this link when a user runs the SpotIQ analysis on the data obtained from a search query, saved answer, or a visualization in a Liveboard. This link points users to the *SpotIQ Analyses* page and is sent in email notifications.

* Links to unsubscribe from notifications
+
The *Unsubscribe* link is included in system-generated emails to allow users to turn off email notifications. This link points users to the *Profile* settings page in ThoughtSpot.

== Link format for a ThoughtSpot embedded instance

By default, ThoughtSpot generates links that point users to a standalone ThoughtSpot application URL. For embedded instances, you might want to generate links in the format that preserves your host application context. 

The *Links* page in the Developer portal displays the default link format for the system-generated links. You can either prefix your application domain URL to the default link format or customize the entire URL. ThoughtSpot recommends that you use the following variables when you customize a link format:

* `{object-id}` to represent the ID of a Liveboard, answer, or the SpotIQ analyses. In  Liveboard, answer, and spotIQ analyses links, this variable is substituted by the GUID of the object.
* `{sub-object-id}` to represent the ID of a visualization. In Liveboard visualization links, this variable is substituted by the GUID of the visualization.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure the {object-id} and {sub-object-id} variables are used only for ThoughtSpot objects. If the link format has two {object-id} variables, your application users may not receive the correct links. For example, if the link format is  `\https://www.mysite.com/?myobject-id={object-id}/liveboard-id={object-id}`, ThoughtSpot may replace both these variables with the Liveboard GUID when it generates the Liveboard link.

== Customize link format

To customize the link format, follow these steps:

. Go to *Develop* > *Customizations* > *Links settings*.
. In the *Links Settings* page, specify the link format.

== Verify the system-generated links

To verify if the links are generated in the format you configured, share a Liveboard with another user.  

* If you are using an embedded instance, click **Copy link **to check if the Liveboard URL is generated in the customized format.

+
For example, if you customized the host name in the URL as `www.mysite.com`, ThoughtSpot generates links with the `www.mysite.com` hostname.

* If you are using a non-embedded ThoughtSpot instance and the Liveboard or answer sharing URL format is customized, ThoughtSpot displays the *Embedded link format* checkbox. To copy the URL in the customized format, click *Embedded link format*.
