ThoughtSpot lets you add custom actions globally for all your visualizations in the Developer portal. If you have Developer or Admin privileges, you can create a  *Global* or *Local* custom action. By default, the *Global* custom actions are placed in the **More** menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu]. The *Local* custom actions are not placed anywhere in the ThoughtSpot UI until you add them to a worksheet, pinboard visualization, saved answer, or a chart or table built from a new search.

To view the custom actions available on your cluster, click the *Custom actions* icon image:./images/custom-action-icon.png[the Custom actions menu] on any visualization or saved answer page, chart, or table. 

The *Custom actions* panel allows you to perform the following actions:

* Add a local custom action to a visualization page
+
You can add a custom action to the visualization and place the action command in the desired location. For example, if you want to send the data obtained from a specific visualization to a URL, you can add a custom action locally to that visualization and set it as a primary action. For more information about assigning actions to a visualization, chart, or table, see xref:custom-actions-viz.adoc[Add a custom action to a visualization].

* Edit a custom action
