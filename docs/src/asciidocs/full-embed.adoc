:page-pageid: full-embed
:page-description: You can embed full ThoughtSpot experience in your application and allow your users to create content for live analytics

To integrate full ThoughtSpot experience in your application, you can use the full app embedding method.

The full app embedding allows you to integrate many features and pages of the ThoughtSpot application, and provide your users the ability to perform the following tasks:
* create answers and pinboards
* share objects with other users
* upload data, and refresh uploaded data
* relate uploaded data to existing worksheets
* use saved answers
* use SpotIQ
However, your application users will not have access to the following features in the embedded ThoughtSpot instance:

* create worksheets
* create views
* modify profiles
* view the Help Center

To embed the full ThoughtSpot application in your app, website, or product, complete the steps described in the following sections.


== Import the AppEmbed package
Import the AppEmbed SDK library to your application environment:

**npm**
[source,javascript]
----
import {
    AppEmbed,
    Page,
    AuthType,
    init,
    prefetch,
    EmbedEvent
}
from '@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk';
----

**ES6**
[source,javascript]
----
<script type = 'module'>
    import {
        AppEmbed,
        Page,
        AuthType,
        init,
        prefetch,
        EmbedEvent
    }
from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk/dist/tsembed.es.js';
----

== Initialize the SDK

Specify the hostname or IP address of your ThoughtSpot application instance and the authentication type.

[source,javascript]
----
init({
    thoughtSpotHost: "https://<hostname>:<port>",
    authType: AuthType.SSO,
});
----
thoughtSpotHost::
_String_. Hostname or IP address of the ThoughtSpot application.

include::{path}/embed-auth-config.adoc[]

== Prefetch static resources (Optional)

To prefetch static resources and load your application fast, set the `callPrefetch` attribute to `true`.

For more information, see xref:prefetch-and-cache.adoc[Prefetch static resources].

== Create an instance of the AppEmbed object
Create an instance of the AppEmbed object and pass the parameters for the application page view.

[source,javascript]
----
const appEmbed = new AppEmbed(document.getElementById('ts-embed'), {
    frameParams: {
        width: '100%',
        height: '100%',
    },
    disabledActions: [],
    disabledActionReason: '<reason for disabling>',
    disableHelpAndProfile: false,
    hideObjects: ['<object-id>'],
    hiddenActions: [],
    showPrimaryNavbar: true,
    pageId: Page.Data,
    path: '<url-string>',
    runtimeFilters: [],
    tag: '<tag-name>',
});
----
frameParams:: Sets the `width` and `height` dimensions to render the pages in the web application. You can set the `width` and `height` attribute values in pixels or as a percentage.

disabledActions::
_Array of strings_. Disables the specified actions. You can use this attribute to restrict user access to certain features.
+
For example, to disable the *Show underlying data* action in the *More* menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu], specify `Action.ShowUnderlyingData` in the `disabledActions` attribute.
+
[source,JavaScript]
----
disabledActions: [Action.ShowUnderlyingData]
----
+
++++
<a href="{{previewPrefix}}/playground/fullApp?modifyActions=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_blank">Try it out</a>
++++

disabledActionReason::
_String_. Reason for disabling an action on a pinboard or visualization page. To display a tooltip for the disabled menu item, specify the reason for disabling the menu item in the `disabledActionReason` attribute.

hiddenActions::
_Array of strings_.Hides the specified actions from the list of available actions in the embedded ThoughtSpot UI. You can use this attribute to remove the actions that are not relevant to your application context. Use this attribute only if `visibleActions` are not defined.

+
For example, to hide the *Share* action, specify `Action.Share` in the `hiddenActions` attribute.

+
----
hiddenActions: [Action.Share]
----

+
++++
<a href="{{previewPrefix}}/playground/fullApp?modifyActions=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_blank">Try it out</a>
++++

For a complete list of action menu items and the corresponding strings to use for disabling or hiding menu items, see xref:embed-actions.adoc[Disable or hide UI actions].

[NOTE]
====
ThoughtSpot automatically creates a modifiable action ID based on the name you assign to a custom action. For example, if you set the name of a custom action as `Send Email`, ThoughtSpot sets the ID for this action as `send-email` by default. To disable, hide, or show a custom action in the embedded UI, you must specify the ID of the custom action as the action string in the `disabledActions`, and `hiddenActions` attributes.
====

+
disableProfileAndHelp::
_Boolean_. When set to `true`, the help and user profile buttons are hidden on the top navigation bar. You can use this attribute to hide these icons if the `showPrimaryNavbar` attribute is set to `true`.

++++
<a href="{{previewPrefix}}/playground/fullApp?disableProfileAndHelp=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_blank">Try it out</a>
++++

hideObjects _optional_::
__Array of Strings__. Hides the specified objects. For example, if you do not want your application users to view certain pinboards, you can specify the GUIDs of the pinboards in the `hideObjects` attribute.

+
[source,JavaScript]
----
hideObjects: ['11f5d5e8-2328-4817-a106-9eff17531e77','e2f49cdd-4d54-466a-841a-e7ecbd9b4400']
----

showPrimaryNavbar::
_Boolean_. Shows or hides the ThoughtSpot navigation bar.

+
++++
<a href="{{previewPrefix}}/playground/fullApp?showNavBar=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_blank">Try it out</a>
++++


path::
_String_. The URL path of the ThoughtSpot application page to embed.

+
[NOTE]
If both `path` and `pageId` attributes are defined, the path definition takes precedence.

pageId::
The unique identifier for the ThoughtSpot application page. The value specified in the `pageId` attribute will be set as the active tab, which is displayed by default when the embedded ThoughtSpot UI loads. Valid values are:

* `*Page.Search*`
+
Displays the page showing ThoughtSpot search bar

* `*Page.Answers*`
+
Displays the saved answers (*Answers*) page

* `*Page.Pinboards*`
+
Displays the *Pinboards* page

* `*Page.Data*`
+
Displays the *Data* page

* `*Page.Home*`
+
Displays the *Home* page


+
++++
<a href="{{previewPrefix}}/playground/fullApp?pageId=search" id="preview-in-playground" target="_blank">Try it out</a>
++++


runtimeFilters [small]_optional_::
Runtime filters to be applied when the pinboard or visualization page loads.
Runtime filters provide the ability to pass filter specifications in the URL query parameters and filter data at the time of retrieval.
+
For example, to sort values equal to `100000` in the `Revenue` column for a visualization in a pinboard, you can pass the runtime filter in the URL query parameters as shown here:
+
[source,javascript]
----
runtimeFilters: [{
    columnName: 'Revenue',
    operator: 'EQ',
    values: [100000]
}]
----


++++
<a href="{{previewPrefix}}/playground/fullApp?runtimeFilters=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_blank">Try it out</a>
++++

include::{path}/runtime-filter.adoc[]

For more information about the supported data types and how to use runtime filters, see xref:runtime-filters.adoc[Runtime filters].

tag [small]_optional_::
__String__. Filters objects by the specified tag. If the pinboards and answers in your application are tagged as `Sales`, you can specify the tag string as `Sales` to show only those objects that have the `Sales` tag assigned.
+
This attribute applies the tag filter at the application level. All metadata objects in the application, such as pinboards and answers, would be filtered by the tag.

+
[source, javascript]
----
tag: 'sales'
----

== Define a method to process callback custom actions payload

include::{path}/callback-payload.adoc[]

== Subscribe to events

Register event listeners.
[source, javascript]
----
appEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.init, showLoader)
appEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.load, hideLoader)
----

For more information, see xref:embed-events.adoc[Event subscription and handling].

== Render the embedded application
Render the embedded content.
[source, javascript]
----
appEmbed.render();
----

== Test the embedded workflow

To verify the ThoughtSpot application integration, perform the following tasks:

* Load your application.
* Verify if the page you set as the active tab opens when you load the application.
* Verify if the tabs are displayed correctly.
* Verify if the page view parameters, such as hiding or showing the data source panel, function as expected.
* If you have disabled a menu item on a ThoughtSpot application page, verify if the menu command is disabled.
