:page-description: Embed Data using REST APIs

To query ThoughtSpot objects and embed them in a web page, portal, or application, you can use the data REST APIs. The data REST APIs return data as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects.

== Embed pinboard or visualization data
To embed a pinboard or visualization, construct the URL for the REST API call:

. Log in to ThoughtSpot from a browser.
. Navigate to the pinboard from which you want to get data.
. Find the ID number of the object you want to get the data from.
+ 
To embed a pinboard, click the ellipses (...) icon, and then select *Copy embed link*.

+

+
To embed a visualization:

.. Navigate to the table or chart
.. Click the ellipses (...) icon in the upper right corner of the table or chart.
.. Click *Copy embed link* icon.
+
[.widthAuto]
image::./images/copy_link.png[Copy link, width=auto]
. Copy the ID number from the link.
Paste it somewhere so that you can use it later to construct the URL for the REST API call.

+
If the object is a pinboard, copy the identifier that appears after `viz/`.

+
[.widthAuto]
image::./images/copy_link_pinboard.png[Copy pinboard link, width=auto]

+
For visualizations (table or chart), copy the IDs that appear after `viz/`. 
+
[.widthAuto]
image::./images/copy_link_viz_pinboard_part.png[Copy visualization link, width=auto]

. Construct the URL. 
+
For a pinboard, the URL is as follows:

+
----
https://<ThoughtSpot-host>/callosum/v1/tspublic/v1/pinboarddata?id=<pinboard_id>
----
+
For a visualization, the URL is as follows:

+
----
https://<ThoughtSpot-host>/callosum/v1/tspublic/v1/pinboarddata?id=<pinboard_id>&vizid=%5B<visualization_id>%5D
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Make sure you add brackets around the `vizid` parameter. The URL encoding for the opening bracket is `%5B` and the closing bracket is `%5D`. 
====

+
. To apply filters to the data, use runtime filters.

+
For example, to sort values equal to `red` in the `Color` column for a visualization in a pinboard, you can pass the runtime filter in the URL query parameters as shown here:

+
----
http://<ThoughtSpot-host>/callosum/v1/tspublic/v1/pinboarddata
?id=<pinboard_id>&vizid=%5B<visualization_id>%5D
&col1=color&op1=EQ&val1=red
----

. After you construct the URL, send a POST request to get data from ThoughtSpot.

+
The Data REST API returns the data formatted as JSON.
. Retrieve the data from the JSON and embed it in your Web page, Web portal, or application.

=== Apply runtime filters

Runtime filters allow you to apply filters to the data returned by the APIs. The filters are specified in the called URL as parameters. 

===== Runtime filter operators
You can use the following operators when applying Runtime filters on a visualization or pinboard.

[width="50%" cols="1,2,1"]
[options='header']
|===
|Operator|Description|Number of Values

| `EQ`
| equals
| 1

| `NE`
| does not equal
| 1

| `LT`
| less than
| 1

| `LE`
| less than or equal to
| 1

| `GT`
| greater than
| 1

| `GE`
| greater than or equal to
| 1

| `CONTAINS`
| contains
| 1

| `BEGINS_WITH`
| begins with
| 1

| `ENDS_WITH`
| ends with
| 1

| `BW_INC_MAX`
| between inclusive of the higher value
| 2

| `BW_INC_MIN`
| between inclusive of the lower value
| 2

| `BW_INC`
| between inclusive
| 2

| `BW`
| between non-inclusive
| 2
|===

===== Supported data types
You can use runtime filters on these data types:

* VARCHAR
* BIGINT
* INT
* FLOAT
* DOUBLE
* BOOLEAN
* DATE
* DATE_TIME
* TIME

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `DATE` and `DATE_TIME` data type requires you to provide the date and time values in the Epoch time format, The Epoch time is also referred POSIX or Unix time. The Epoch timestamp is always in GMT/UTC time. You may have to convert time zones to calculate the appropriate timestamp.

For example, if you want to filter data for 2020-05-22, you can specify the date value in the Epoch time format as `1590192000`, or use the following JavaScript method to calculate the timestamp:

----
new Date('2020-05-22').getTime() / 1000
----
====
==== Apply runtime filters to a visualization

To apply runtime filters to a pinboard, use the following format in the REST API call:

[source]
----
http://<ThoughtSpot-host>:<port>
/callosum/v1/tspublic/v1/pinboarddata
?id=<pinboard_id>
&col1=<column_name\>&op1=<operator\>&val1=<value\>
----
To apply runtime filters to a specific visualization object in a pinboard, use the following format in the REST API call:
 
[source]
----
http://<thoughtspot_server>:<port>
/callosum/v1/tspublic/v1/pinboarddata
?id=<pinboard_id>&vizid=%5B<visualization_id>%5D
&col1=<column_name\>&op1=<operator\>&val1=<value\>
----

To add additional filters on a particular column, you can specify multiple values by separating them with `&` (ampersand) as in the example:
 
[source]
----
val1=foo&val1=bar
----

You can also use the `IN` operator for multiple values, as shown in this example:
 
[source]
----
 col1=<column_name>&op1=IN&val1=<value>&val1=<value>
----

You can add additional filters by incrementing the number at the end of each parameter in the *Runtime Filter* for each filter you want to add, for example, `col2`, `op2`, `val2`, and so on.

This example passes multiple variables to a single column as well as multiple columns.
It shows that data values are returned as epoch.

[source]
----
  col1=region&op1=IN&val1=midwest&val1=south&val1=northeast
  &col2=date&op2=BET&val2=<epoch_start>&val2=<epoch_end>
----

[NOTE]
====
Runtime Filters can also be applied on visualizations or pinboards embedded in your application. You can specify the runtime filter criteria in the SDK when embedding ThoughtSpot objects. For more information, see xref:embed-a-viz.adoc[Embed a visualization] and xref:embed-pinboard.adoc[Embed a pinboard].
