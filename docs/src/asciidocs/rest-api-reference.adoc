*Pinboards are now Liveboards!*

Effective from ThoughtSpot 8.4.0-sw (Limited Availability) release, ThoughtSpot pinboards are rebranded as Liveboards.
As part of this rebranding, we have made some terminology changes in the ThoughtSpot UI and documentation artifacts.
However, the REST v1 API endpoints URLs, request and response workflows will continue to use the legacy terminology for backward compatibility.
