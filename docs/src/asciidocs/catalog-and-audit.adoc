:page-description: ThoughtSpot REST APIs can be used to audit system configurations and bring metadata into data catalogs

The ThoughtSpot REST API can easily retrieve information about the objects stored on the ThoughtSpot server. 

== Map user and group GUIDs to names
Some API responses only include the GUIDs for other objects, without the string names. If you need the human-readable names of users and groups, use the xref:user-api.adoc#get-user-details[get user details] and the xref:group-api.adoc#get-ug-details [get group details] endpoints. 

These calls include the names along with the GUIDs, allowing you to map the string name values to any GUID returned within another call.
