This article provides information about new features, enhancements, and deprecated functionality in ThoughtSpot Everywhere.


== September 2021

[width="100%" cols="1,4"]
|====
|[tag greenBackground]#New feature# a| +++<h5>+++New ThoughtSpot Everywhere Edition license+++</h5>+++

ThoughtSpot introduces the ThoughtSpot Everywhere Edition license that grants access to ThoughtSpot Everywhere features, such as the Developer portal, Playground, customization workflows, Visual Embed SDK, and REST APIs. If you have a ThoughtSpot Enterprise Cloud Service subscription and you want to avail the benefits of ThoughtSpot Everywhere, you can now request for a license upgrade.

The new licensing model introduces several notable changes in the ThoughtSpot Developer portal:

* On clusters that _do not_ have the ThoughtSpot Everywhere Edition license, the ThoughtSpot Developer Portal displays a locked icon next to the customization menu actions. When you click the locked icon, the UI prompts you to sign up for a free trial or upgrade your license. 
* The ThoughtSpot Enterprise Cloud service subscribers can either start a 30-day free trial or initiate a license upgrade from the UI.  
* Free trial users can initiate a license upgrade request by clicking **Upgrade Now** at any time during the evaluation period, or when the trial expires.
* If you click *Upgrade* or **Upgrade Now**, ThoughtSpot opens the Live Chat Support widget. You can start a conversation with the Sales personnel to initiate the license upgrade.  

For more information about the licensing model and upgrade process, see xref:get-started-tse.adoc[Get started with ThoughtSpot Everywhere].

|[tag greenBackground]#New feature#  a| +++<h5>+++Developer Playground enhancements+++</h5>+++

* The *Full app* Playground page includes the *Hide profile and help* checkbox to provide a preview of the `disableHelpAndProfile` function that can hide the Help and Profile icons in the ThoughtSpot navigation bar.

* The *Full Height* checkbox in *Pinboard* Playground provides a preview of the `fullHeight` attribute that can dynamically resize the embedded pinboard frame according to the height of the pinboard.

[width="100%" cols="1,4"]
|====
||
|[tag greenBackground]#New feature# a|+++<h5>+++Prefetch API+++</h5>+++

The `prefetch` API fetches static resources from a given URL before your application loads. Web browsers can then cache the prefetched resources locally and serve them from a user's local disk. You can use this API to load the embedded objects faster and improve your application response time. 

For more information, see xref:prefetch-and-cache.adoc[Prefetch static resources].

|[tag greenBackground]#New feature# a|+++<h5>+++In-app page navigation+++</h5>+++

The `navigateToPage` method in the SDK lets you provide quick and direct access to a specific pinboard, saved answer, or an application page. You can add a custom menu action or button in your application UI that calls the `navigateToPage` method and leads your users to the page specified in the `path` parameter.

For more information, see xref:page-navigation.adoc[Add a custom action for in-app navigation].

|[tag greenBackground]#New feature# a|+++<h5>+++Full application embedding+++</h5>+++

The `appEmbed` SDK package includes the following new attributes: 

* The `disableProfileAndHelp` attribute to show or hide the `Help (?)` and the user profile menu in the navigation bar of your embedded app. 

* The `hideObjects` attribute to hide specific objects from a user's page view.  

For more information, see xref:full-embed.adoc[Embed full application].

|[tag greenBackground]#New feature# |+++<h5>+++Search embed +++</h5>+++

The `searchEmbed` package includes the `forceTable` attribute that sets tabular view as the default format for presenting search data. You can use set this attribute to `true` to force search results to appear in the table view. 

For more information, see xref:embed-search.adoc[Embed ThoughtSpot search].

== August 2021

=== Custom actions

The ThoughtSpot 7 Cloud August release introduces the following features:

[width="100%" cols="1,4"]
|====
||
|[tag greenBackground]#New feature# a| *Custom actions for worksheets*

The worksheet pages now include a `Custom actions` tab that shows the custom actions created in the Developer portal. ThoughtSpot users can add these  actions to a worksheet and place them as primary actions or menu items in the new visualizations built from that worksheet.

This feature is available to all ThoughtSpot users who have edit privileges to a worksheet.

For more information, see xref:custom-actions-worksheet.adoc[Add custom actions to a worksheet].

|[tag greenBackground]#New feature# a|**Query parameters for URL-based custom actions**

The Developer portal now allows you to add arbitrary key-value pairs as query parameters for a URL action. If a URL endpoint requires specific information, such as the database details or data object attributes, you can add a key-value pair of these attributes when creating a custom action. When the custom action workflow is triggered, these attributes are passed as query parameters in `GET` requests to get the data payload from ThoughtSpot.

For more information, see xref:custom-actions-url.adoc[Configure a custom URL action].
|====

=== Visual Embed SDK

The ThoughtSpot 7 Cloud August release supports Visual Embed SDK version 1.3.1, which includes the following features and enhancements.

[width="100%" cols="1,4"]
|====
||
|[tag greenBackground]#New feature#  a| *searchOptions*

The `searchEmbed` SDK package introduces the `searchOptions` parameter for setting search tokens. The `searchOptions` parameter includes the following attributes:

* `searchTokenString`
+
A TML query string to define search tokens.

* `executeSearch`
+
When set to `true`, it executes search and shows the search results.

For more information, see xref:embed-search.adoc#search-query[Embed ThoughtSpot search].

|[tag redBackground]#Deprecated# a|**searchQuery**

The `searchQuery` parameter in the `searchEmbed` SDK package is deprecated in the Visual Embed SDK version 1.3.1. Instead, you can use the `searchOptions` parameter to define the search token string.

For more information about `searchOptions`, see xref:embed-search.adoc#search-query[Embed ThoughtSpot search].

|[tag greenBackground]#New feature# a|**autoLogin**

The SDK now supports logging in users automatically after a user session has expired.

For more information, see xref:embed-authentication.adoc##embed-session-sec[Embed user authentication]. 

|[tag greenBackground]##New feature## a|**shouldEncodeUrlQueryParams**

You can now convert query parameters in the ThoughtSpot generated URLs to base64-encoded format. You can enable this attribute to secure your cluster from cross-site scripting attacks.
|[tag redBackground]#Breaking change# a|**Data structure changes in custom action response payloads**

* The  data structure passed in the custom action response for search now shows as `payload.data.embedAnswerData` instead of `payload.data.columnsAndData`.

* The answer payload for custom actions includes the following metadata:

** `reportBookmetadata`
+
Includes visualization metadata attributes such as description, object header metadata, author details, timestamp of the answer creation, and modification.

** user data
+
Includes user information such as username, GUID of the user, and email address.

To view a sample response payload, see xref:callback-response-payload.adoc#search-data-payload[Custom action response payload].

|[tag greenBackground]#New feature# a|**preventPinboardFilterRemoval**

The `pinboardEmbed` SDK package now includes the `preventPinboardFilterRemoval` attribute. You can use this attribute to disable the filter removal action and thus prevent users from removing the filter chips added on a pinboard page.

For more information, see xref:embed-pinboard.adoc[Embed a pinboard] and xref:embed-a-viz.adoc[Embed a visualization].
|[tag greenBackground]#New feature# a|**suppressNoCookieAccessAlert**

You can now set custom alerts for `noCookieAccess` events. By default, the SDK triggers a `noCookieAcess` event and generates an alert when a user's browser blocks third-party cookies. The `suppressNoCookieAccessAlert` allows you to disable this alert. 

|[tag greenBackground]#New feature# a|**Support for fetching callback custom action payload in batches**

The Visual Embed SDK now supports processing data in batches for callback custom action responses.
The callback custom action event in the SDK package supports defining `batchSize` and `offset` values to paginate the answer payload and send the records in batches.

For more information, see xref:push-data-to-external-app.adoc#large-dataset[Callback custom action workflow].

== June 2021

The ThoughtSpot 7 Cloud June release introduces the following features and enhancements:

=== Global and local custom actions

The ThoughtSpot developer portal now supports configuring a custom action as a __global__ or __local__ action. This feature allows you to determine and control the placement of custom actions in the ThoughtSpot UI. Developers can now choose to create a custom action that will appear on all visualizations, or a specific custom action that can be added to a visualization by a ThoughtSpot user. The custom actions panel in the visualization page allows ThoughtSpot users to view the available custom actions and add an action to any visualization.

For example, if you want an action that triggers a callback into your parent app, which would then post its data to Slack, you might want to add a custom action globally to all visualizations. Similarly, if you want to send the data obtained from a specific visualization to a URL, you can associate a custom action locally to that visualization.

For more information, see xref:customize-actions-menu.adoc[Custom actions] and xref:custom-actions-viz.adoc[Add a custom action to a specific visualization].

=== Authentication schemes for custom actions

You can now apply an authentication scheme for a custom action that triggers a data payload to a specific URL target. If an action requires your users to authenticate to send  data to a URL, you can specify the authentication method and authorization attributes when creating a custom action in the Developer portal.
ThoughtSpot will use this information to send the required attributes in the `Authorization` headers to the URL endpoint configured in the custom action.

=== Custom action position settings

ThoughtSpot users with edit privileges can now define or modify the position of a custom action on visualization pages. When a developer creates a custom action in the Developer portal, ThoughtSpot adds a menu item to the **More** image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] menu by default. ThoughtSpot users can change this to a context menu action or a primary action at any time.

If your application instance requires an action that sends only a single row of data from charts or tables, developers can configure a custom action and restrict it to only the contextual menu. If this setting is enabled on a custom action, ThoughtSpot users cannot modify this action on a visualization page.

For more information, see xref:custom-actions-viz.adoc[Add a custom action to a specific visualization].

=== Custom link format for ThoughtSpot embedded instances

ThoughtSpot generates links to access objects, such as pinboards, visualizations, and answers, when a user shares an object with another user or follows a pinboard to receive periodic notifications. If you have embedded ThoughtSpot in your application, you might want to generate these links in the format that preserves your host application context.

For embedded instances, ThoughtSpot now allows you to customize the format of these links in the Developer portal. The *Link Settings* page in the Developer portal allows you to customize the link format for various resource URLs and the *unsubscribe* link sent in email notifications.

For more information, see xref:customize-links.adoc[Customize links].

=== REST APIs

The ThoughtSpot 7 Cloud June release introduces the following REST API endpoints:
