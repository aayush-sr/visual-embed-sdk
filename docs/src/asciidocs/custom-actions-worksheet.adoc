:page-description: Add custom actions to worksheets


ThoughtSpot supports adding custom actions to the visualizations built from worksheets. The custom actions created in the Developer portal appear on a worksheet page, so that your users can add these actions to the new visualizations built from that worksheet. This feature allows ThoughtSpot application users to determine and control the position of a custom action on visualizations generated from a specific worksheet. 

[NOTE]
====
When you add a custom action to a worksheet, ThoughtSpot adds the action only to the new visualizations built from that worksheet. The existing saved answers generated using that worksheet do not show the custom actions assigned to the worksheet.
====

== Before you begin

* Make sure the custom actions are set as *Local*. If you have Developer or Admin privilege, you can create custom actions in the Developer portal and view the custom action availability in the *Custom actions* > *Actions* dashboard.
* Make sure you have edit permissions to modify the worksheet.
* Make sure the link:https://cloud-docs.thoughtspot.com/admin/ts-cloud/new-answer-experience[new Answer experience, window=_blank] is enabled on your cluster.

== Associate a custom action to a worksheet

To add a custom action to a worksheet:

. Go to *Data* > *Data Objects* > *Worksheets*.
. Click the worksheet that you want to modify.
. Click the *Custom actions* tab.
+
A list of __Global__ actions is displayed. 

+
[NOTE]
====
The *Global* custom actions appear on all visualizations by default. To add a specific action locally to a worksheet, the *Local* custom actions must be created in the Developer portal.
====

. Click *Add action*.
. Select the custom action that you want to add.
. To specify the position of the action, select one of the following options:
* *Primary*
+
Sets the custom action as a primary menu action.
+
[NOTE]
====
ThoughtSpot allows only one primary action on a visualization page. If visualizations generated from the worksheet already have a primary action, the new configuration overrides this setting.

If a visualization built from this worksheet already has a primary action added locally at the visualization level, ThoughtSpot will retain this configuration and does not apply the primary action added at the worksheet level.  
====

* *Menu*
+
Adds the custom action to the  **More** menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu].

* *Context menu*
+
Adds the custom action as a menu item in the contextual menu. If you want to send only a single row of data instead of the entire data set from a visualization, you can place the custom action in the contextual menu. Users can access this action in the contextual menu by right-clicking on a visualization.

+
 
. Preview  the position of the custom action.

. Click *Save*.
+
The custom action is added to the visualization page. 

== Verify the custom action placement

. To view the action you just added, click *Home*.
. Set your worksheet as the data source, specify search tokens, and click search.
+
. Verify if the action is added to the visualization page. 

+
When you save this visualization in answers or pin it to a Liveboard, all users that can access the visualization can use this action.

== Edit a custom action association

. Navigate to the worksheet page.
