:page-description: ThoughtSpot REST API provides service endpoints for administration, embedding, and data management.

The ThoughtSpot REST API framework lets you create, access, edit, and manage objects and resources in the ThoughtSpot system programmatically. 
 
ThoughtSpot REST API supports several resource collections and operations in two distinct versions: 

* REST API v1
+
The legacy framework with several endpoints to create, edit, administer and manage ThoughtSpot objects and data. 

* REST API V2 
+
The REST API v2 [beta blueBackground]^BETA^ framework is a new developer-focused solution that provides additional functionality and an interactive Playground experience. The REST v2 framework also supports language-specific SDK and client libraries.

+
[NOTE]
====
The REST API v2 is a limited availability feature and is in Beta. To enable this feature on your instance, contact ThoughtSpot Support.

For more information about the differences between these two REST API versions, see xref:rest-api-v1v2-comparison.adoc[REST API v1 and v2 comparison].

== REST API Playground

ThoughtSpot users with Developer or Administrator privileges can access the REST v1 and v2 endpoints in the Developer portal. If the REST API SDK and Playground [beta blueBackground]^BETA^ feature is enabled on your cluster, you can see the *REST Playground v1* and **REST Playground v2** menu options under *REST API* in the *Develop* tab.

The portal provides a separate Playground for each version and lets you explore the API endpoints and make an API call. 

* To try out the xref:rest-api-v1.adoc[REST v1 APIs], click **REST Playground v1**.

* To access the xref:rest-api-v2.adoc[REST v2 Playground], click **REST Playground v2**.
