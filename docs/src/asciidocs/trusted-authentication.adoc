:page-description: Trusted Authentication

The trusted authentication mode of single sign-on specifies a method for an *authenticator service* to programmatically request __login tokens__ from ThoughtSpot, which can then be used to sign in a user to the ThoughtSpot instance. The login token is only necessary during the login process, after which ThoughtSpot establishes a user session using cookies.

_You_ must implement the actual authentication of the inbound request for a token within the authenticator service. This is why the method is called trusted authentication&#8212;ThoughtSpot trusts the authenticator service to request a login token for any user. 

The authenticator service must have secure access to the `secret_key` for the ThoughtSpot instance. With that `secret_key`, the authenticator service can make a REST API request for a login token for any existing user within ThoughtSpot. This login token is then sent to the user's web browser, where it is used in the login process.

== Key components

The trusted authentication workflow involves several entities, such as the web browser, web application, authenticator service, and the ThoughtSpot application server.

=== Authenticator service

The authenticator service should exist at the web application tier of your networks, with secure access to the ThoughtSpot `secret_key`. It performs the following functions:

* Authenticate users who request access to the embedded content
* Request a token from ThoughtSpot on a user’s behalf, using the `secret_key` for the ThoughtSpot instance
* Return the token to the user's web browser

There are no requirements to how the authenticator service is built or hosted, other than being able to issue REST API commands to the ThoughtSpot instance and having access to the `secret_key`. When using ThoughtSpot Cloud, the authenticator service will need outbound request access to the hosted ThoughtSpot cloud instance. 

The authenticator service can also issue REST API commands to xref:auth-overview.adoc[create users and set additional authentication properties].

=== ThoughtSpot server

For a token-based authentication method, ThoughtSpot administrators must xref:trusted-authentication.adoc#trusted-auth-enable[enable Trusted authentication] in the *Develop* > *Customization* > *Security settings* page of the ThoughtSpot UI. This setting allows ThoughtSpot administrators to obtain a `secret_key`, which is required for requesting access to ThoughtSpot on a user’s behalf.

The `secret_key` must be stored in a secure fashion such that only the trusted authenticator service can use it.

=== Login token

The login token, also referred to as the authentication token, allows users to access the requested object.

Tokens stay valid for a length of time based on the following rules:

* A token stays valid indefinitely until another token for any user is generated.
* When a new token is generated using the same `secret_key`, the previous token will expire after five minutes.
* When a new `secret_key` is generated for the ThoughtSpot server and the first new login token is obtained using the new `secret_key`, all tokens generated using the previous `secret_key` become invalid.
* If users make multiple attempts to log in to ThoughtSpot using an invalid or expired token, they may get locked out of their accounts.

To set a consistent five minute expiration time, you can generate a second token to start the expiration clock for the previous login token that is sent to the user's browser.

[#trusted-auth-enable]
== Enable trusted authentication
You need ThoughtSpot admin privileges to enable trusted authentication.

. Log in to the ThoughtSpot.
. Click the *Develop* tab.
. Under *Customizations*, click *Settings*.
. To enable trusted authentication, turn on the toggle.
+
A `secret_key` for trusted authentication is generated. This `secret_key` is required for obtaining an authentication token for a ThoughtSpot user.

. Click the clipboard icon to copy the token.
+
The following example shows a ThoughtSpot-generated secret key string.

+
----
b0cb26a0-351e-40b4-9e42-00fa2265d50c
----
This key is required for making API calls to get a token for ThoughtSpot users.

. Store the key in a secure location.
. Click *Save Changes*.

== Implement an authenticator service

The following illustration depicts the authentication workflow with the authenticator service:

image::./images/trusted-auth-workflow.png[Trusted Authentication Workflow]

[NOTE]
====
The authenticator service makes REST API requests to ThoughtSpot. To make a REST API request for a login token, the authenticator service must have xref:api-auth-session.adoc[created an active session] with ThoughtSpot as a *server administrator* acting as a service account. The authenticator service code will need logic to log in if there is no active session, and secure access to the service account credentials.
====

=== Authentication workflow

The user authentication workflow with an authenticator service involves the following steps:

. A user logs into the web application through the web application's authentication mechanism.
. When the user requests access to embedded ThoughtSpot content, the web application sends a request for a login token to the authenticator service.
+
To proceed with authentication, the authenticator service must do the following:

 * Authenticate the request from the web application: it is essential that the request to the authenticator service be valid and only come from the web application.
 * Retrieve the ThoughtSpot username from the request.
 * [Optional] Determine the ID of a specific ThoughtSpot object from the request: you can request a limited token using the `access_level=REPORT_BOOK_VIEW` option, but this is rarely used.
. Authenticator service sends a POST request to the ThoughtSpot server with the `secret_key` and `username` attributes to obtain an authentication token on the user's behalf.
+
----
POST /tspublic/v1/session/auth/token
----
+
This POST request body includes the following `formData` attributes:

* `secret_key`
+

__String__. The `secret_key` obtained from ThoughtSpot.

* `username`
+
__String__. The `username` of the ThoughtSpot user.

* `access_level`
+
__String__. Mode of access. Valid values are:

** `FULL`
+
Allows access to the entire ThoughtSpot application. When a token has been requested in `FULL` mode, it will create a full ThoughtSpot session in the browser and application. The token for `Full` access mode persists through several sessions and stays valid until another token is generated.


** `REPORT_BOOK_VIEW`
+
Allows access to only one object at a time. The token request for this access mode requires you to specify the GUID of the pinboard or answer. If your application user requires access to another object, a new token request must be sent.

* `id`
+
__String__. The GUID of the pinboard or answer.
This parameter is required only for the `REPORT_BOOK_VIEW` access mode.

. ThoughtSpot verifies the authentication server's request and returns a token.
. The authentication server returns the token to the user's web browser.

+
[NOTE]
====
If you are using the Visual Embed SDK, steps 7 and 8 are handled automatically by the *init* function, where you specify the authenticator service via a URL (`authEndpoint`) or a callback function (`getAuthToken`). For more information, see  xref:trusted-authentication.adoc#trusted-auth-sdk[Trusted authentication workflow with Visual Embed SDK]. 
====

+
. The client application constructs a fully encoded URL with the authentication token and the embedded resource endpoint and sends it as a query parameter in the GET request to the ThoughtSpot application server.
+
[source, HTML]
----
GET https://<ThoughtSpot-host>/callosum/v1/tspublic/v1/session/login/token?username=<user>&auth_token=<token>&redirect_url=<full-encoded-url-with-auth-token>
----
The request URL includes the following attributes:


* `username`
+
_String_. The `username` of the user requesting access to the embedded ThoughtSpot content.

* `auth_token`
+
_String_. The authentication token obtained for the user in step 5.

* `redirect_url`
+
_String_. The URL to which the user is redirected after successful authentication. The URL is fully encoded and includes the authentication token obtained for the user.
+
For example, if the user has requested access to a specific visualization on a pinboard, the redirect URL includes the domain to which the user is redirected, the auth token string obtained for the user, visualization ID, and pinboard ID.
+
[source, HTML]
----
https://<redirect-domain>/?authtoken=<user_auth_token>&embedApp=true&primaryNavHidden=true#/embed/viz/<pinboard_id>/<viz-id>
----
[NOTE]
The request URL includes the `auth_token` attribute and the redirect URL uses the `authtoken` attribute.

. ThoughtSpot validates the request and allows access to the requested content.

[#trusted-auth-sdk]
=== Authentication workflow with Visual Embed SDK

The Visual Embed SDK simplifies and automates the trusted authentication workflow.

. A user logs into the host application and requests access to the embedded ThoughtSpot content.
. The SDK checks for an existing user session in the browser.
. If there is no session, it obtains a token either from the specified `authEndpoint` URL or by using the `getAuthToken` callback method.
. The SDK uses the obtained auth token and `username` in the `GET` request to the `/tspublic/v1/session/login/token` endpoint.
. If the request is successful, the SDK renders the embedded content.

For more information, see xref:embed-authentication.adoc[Embed user authentication].

== Disable trusted authentication

To disable trusted authentication, follow these steps:

. Go to *Develop* > *Customizations* > *Settings*.
. On the *Settings* page, turn off the *Trusted Authentication* toggle.
+
A pop-up window appears and prompts you to confirm the disable action.

. Click *Disable*.

+
When you disable trusted authentication, the validity of your existing secret key expires. Your application will become inoperable until you add a secret key to the authenticator service.
You must re-enable trusted authentication and then obtain a new secret key.
