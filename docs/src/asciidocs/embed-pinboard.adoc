:page-description: Embed Pinboards


This page explains, through an example, how to embed a ThoughtSpot Pinboard in your Web page, portal, or application.


== Import the PinboardEmbed package
Import the PinboardEmbed SDK library to your application environment:

[source,javascript]
----
import { PinboardEmbed, AuthType, init } from '@thoughtspot/visual-embed-sdk';
----

== Add the embed domain

To allow your client application to connect to ThoughtSpot:

. Configure the URL with ThoughtSpot hostname or IP address.
. Specify the authentication method to use for authenticating application users.

include::{path}/embed-auth-config.adoc[]

For more information, see xref:embed-authentication.adoc[Embed user authentication].

== Construct the embed content
[source,JavaScript]
----
const pinboardEmbed = new PinboardEmbed(document.getElementById('ts-embed'), {
	frameParams: {
		width: '100%',
		height: '100%',
	},
	disabledActions: [],
	fullHeight: true,
	disabledActionReason: '<reason for disabling>'
	hiddenActions: [],
	pinboardId: '<%=pinboardGUID%>',
	runtimeFilters: [],
},
});
----
frameParams:: 

Sets the `width` and `height` dimensions to render the iframe containing the pinboard. You can set the `width` and `height` attribute values in pixels or as a percentage. 

fullHeight __Optional__::

_Boolean_. Dynamically resizes the embedded pinboard frame according to the height of the pinboard. 

+
If the embedded pinboard does not fit vertically within your application page, a second scroll bar may appear. When `fullHeight` is set to `true`, the embedded pinboard frame is automatically adjusted according to the height of the pinboard, and the second scroll bar does not appear.

disabledActions::
_Array of strings_. The action menu items to be disabled on the pinboards page.
+

For example, to disable the *Present* action in the *More* menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu], specify `Action.Present` in the `disabledActions` attribute.

+
[source,JavaScript]
----
disabledActions: [Action.Present]
----
////
+
++++
<a href="{{previewPrefix}}/playground/pinboard?modifyActions=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_blank">Try it in Playground</a>
++++
////

For a complete list of action menu items and the corresponding strings, see link:{{visualEmbedSDKPrefix}}/enums/action.html[Action, window=_blank].

[NOTE]
If you have xref:customize-actions-menu.adoc[added a custom action] and you want to disable this custom action, make sure you specify the ID of the custom action in the `disabledActions` attribute. For example, if a custom action is created with the *Send Email* label and the ID is set as *send-email*, use `send-email` in the `disabledActions` attribute to disable this action on the pinboards page.

disabledActionReason::
_String_. The text to show for disabled actions. The text string specified in `disabledActionReason` shows as a tooltip when a user hovers over a disabled action in the embedded UI. For example, if you have disabled the `DownloadAsPDF` action and you intend to enable this action for only authorized users, you can specify `disabledActionReason` as `Contact your administrator to enable this feature`. 


hiddenActions::
_Array of strings_. The action menu items to hide on the Pinboards page.
+

For example, to hide *Add filters* action in the *More* menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu], specify `Action.AddFilter` in the `hiddenActions` attribute.

+
[source,JavaScript]
----
hiddenActions: [Action.AddFilter]

For a complete list of action menu items and the corresponding strings, see link:{{visualEmbedSDKPrefix}}/enums/action.html[Action, window=_blank].

[NOTE]
If you have xref:customize-actions-menu.adoc[added a custom action] and you want to hide this custom action, make sure you specify the ID of the custom action in the `hiddenActions` attribute. For example, if a custom action is created with the *Send Email* label and the ID is set as *send-email*, use `send-email` in the `hiddenActions` attribute to hide this action on the  pinboards page.

pinboardId::
_String_. The GUID of the pinboard.

runtimeFilters [small]_optional_::
Runtime filters to apply when the Pinboard page loads.
Runtime filters provide the ability to filter data at the time of retrieval. Runtime filters allow you to apply a filter to a visualization in a pinboard by passing filter specifications as URL query parameters.
+
For example, to sort values equal to `red` in the `Color` column for a visualization in a pinboard, you can pass the runtime filter in the URL query parameters as shown here:
+
[source,javascript]
----
runtimeFilters: [{
	columnName: 'color',
	operator: RuntimeFilterOp.EQ,
	values: ['red']
}]
----
////

++++
<a href="{{previewPrefix}}/playground/pinboard?runtimeFilters=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_blank">Try it in Playground</a>
++++
////

include::{path}/runtime-filter.adoc[]

For more information about the supported data types and how to use runtime filters, see xref:runtime-filters.adoc[Runtime filters].

== Render the embedded pinboard

Construct the URL for the embedded pinboard and render the embedded content:

[source,JavaScript]
----
pinboardEmbed.render();
----

== Define a method to process callback custom actions payload

include::{path}/callback-payload.adoc[]

== Subscribe to events
Register event handlers to subscribe to the events triggered by the embedded pinboard.

[source,javascript]
----
pinboardEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.init, showLoader)
pinboardEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.load, hideLoader)
pinboardEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.Error)
----

If you have added a xref:customize-actions-menu.adoc[custom action], register an event handler to manage the events triggered by the custom action:

[source, javascript]
----
pinboardEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.customAction, payload => {
	const data = payload.data;
	if(data.id === 'insert Custom Action ID here') {
		console.log('Custom Action event:', data.columnsAndData);
	}
})
----
For a complete list of event types that you can register, see  link:{{visualEmbedSDKPrefix}}/enums/embedevent.html[EmbedEvent, window=_blank].

== Test the embedded workflow

* Load the client application.
* Try accessing a Liveboard embedded in your application.
* Verify if the embedded content renders correctly on your application page. 
* If you have disabled an action, verify if the action appears as disabled on the *Pinboards* page.
* If runtime filters are configured, verify if the filters are applied to the visualizations on the pinboard.
